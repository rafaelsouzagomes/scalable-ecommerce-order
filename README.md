# Project: Scalable E-commerce Order Management System

**Description:** Develop a scalable e-commerce platform that manages orders, inventory, and users, capable of handling a large number of simultaneous accesses. This project should include a comparison of SQL and NoSQL databases, implementations of load balancing, sharding, caching, and API resilience.

**Key Features:**

**Order Management:**

- Create, update, and view orders.
- View order history.

**Inventory Management:**

- Add, update, and remove products.
- Real-time stock control.

**User Management:**

- User registration and login.
- User profile and purchase history.

**Product Search:**

- Implementation of fast and efficient search functionalities.

**Study/Practice Topics:**

- **Spring Boot** for building the application.
- **Spring Cloud** for microservices management.
- **Spring Data JPA** for persistence with SQL databases.
- **Spring Data MongoDB** for persistence with NoSQL databases.
- **Spring Security** with OAuth2 and JWT for authentication and authorization.
- **Docker** and **Kubernetes** for containerization and orchestration.
- **Load Balancing** with NGINX or Kubernetes Ingress.
- **Sharding** with MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
- **Caching** with Redis.
- **Apache Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** for asynchronous communication.
- **Hystrix** or **Resilience4j** for API resilience.
- **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring and metrics.
- **CI/CD** with Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
- **Testing**: Unit, Integration, and Performance with JUnit, Mockito, and Testcontainers.

**Project Steps:**

1. **System Architecture:**

   **Microservices:**

   - **User Service:** User management and authentication.
   - **Order Service:** Order management.
   - **Inventory Service:** Inventory management.
   - **Search Service:** Product search.
   - **API Gateway:** Request routing.
   - **Config Server:** Centralized configuration management.
   - **Service Discovery:** Service discovery with Eureka.

2. **Database:**

   - **SQL:** PostgreSQL for relational data.
   - **NoSQL:** MongoDB for non-relational data.
   - **Comparison:** Implement functionalities in both types of databases and compare performance, scalability, and maintenance.

3. **Load Balancing and Sharding:**

   - **NGINX** or **Kubernetes Ingress** for load balancing.
   - **Sharding** with MongoDB and PostgreSQL for data distribution.

4. **Asynchronous Communication:**

   - **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** for order and inventory events.

5. **Caching:**

   - **Redis** for caching search data and user sessions.

6. **Resilience:**

   - **Hystrix** or **Resilience4j** to implement circuit breakers and fallback strategies.

7. **Monitoring and Metrics:**

   - **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for performance and usage metrics collection and visualization.

8. **CI/CD:**

   - **Jenkins** or **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and delivery pipelines.

**Tools for Load Simulation and Performance Testing:**

- **JMeter:** To simulate load and performance tests.
- **Gatling:** For high-load simulations and performance analysis.
- **Locust:** For distributed load simulations.

**Example Test Scenarios:**

**Simultaneous User Load:**

- Simulate thousands of users accessing the platform at the same time.
- Verify load balancing and microservices response.

**Database Scalability:**

- Insert and query large volumes of data in both SQL and NoSQL databases.
- Measure performance, latency, and throughput.

**API Resilience:**

- Introduce failures in microservices and verify resilience and circuit breakers.

**Comparisons and Metrics:**

- **Performance:** Response time and latency for common operations.
- **Scalability:** Horizontal scaling capacity.
- **Maintenance:** Ease of maintenance and sharding complexity.
- **Cost:** Cost analysis for large-scale operations.
